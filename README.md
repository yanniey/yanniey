### Hi there, I'm Annie (Anyi) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an applied scientist at Yelp working on ad tech such as bid pricing and real time bidding. My typical day is split 50/50 between data science and machine learning engineering. I have a master degree in data science from Birkbeck, University of London, and a bachelor degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from St. John's College, MD in the US.

ðŸ˜„ **I'm currently working on**: 
  * Improving the Ad Auction system at Yelp by running randomised controlled experiments and implementing systems at scale. We use lots of stats!

ðŸŒ± **My Past Projects**:
  *  Solving Computer Vision problems with machine learning and deep learning (OpenCV, scikit-learn, Tensorflow)
  *  Side project: identify cat breeds with Tensorflow
